#HoKMap
First version of the Interactive Map of Honor of the Kings. Both map.png and icons used are not mine, just the initial code.

Instructions for use:

Extract and open the .html in Chrome (Firefox and others may have bugs)

To use:
- 1 click on the hero icons to place a blue border
- 2 clicks on the hero icons to place a red border
- Click and drag on the map with left click to draw/write
- Click and drag on the map with right click to erase what you wrote/drew

I'm leaving it public so that others can take advantage of this to improve the game's international competitive scenario, in addition to making room for this program to become even better.

I'm also working on a better, mobile-friendly version of this program(currently Android-only).
